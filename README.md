# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Applied Statistics & Cognitive Neuroscience
- I am taking STATS 220 because I found its overviews quite interesting for a 3rd core course choice in Stage 2.
- I am interested in learning about real graphic applications of R coding and imagery/instinctive statistics
