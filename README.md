# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about me:

<!--- numbered lists --->
1. I am undertaking a degree in **Bachelor of Science**, majoring in *Applied Statistics & Cognitive Neuroscience*.
2. I am taking STATS 220 because I found its overviews quite interesting for a 3rd core course choice in Stage 2.
3. I am interested in learning about real graphic applications of R coding and imagery/instinctive statistics. I have loved using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and doing activities on [Canvas](https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/). Moreover, I like watching [RProgramming101 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RProgramming101/videos) to further hone my R programming and staitsical skills.

#### Personal Note:
<!--- unordered lists --->
* I would love more assistance and company in this course through the form of turtors and peers, as I am still very overwhelmened about the overload of programming in Stats right now and it's hard to find trustwrothy resources or mates :/
* A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![Sad Pigeon](https://c.tenor.com/Pa3SHW2PCX0AAAAd/tenor.gif)
